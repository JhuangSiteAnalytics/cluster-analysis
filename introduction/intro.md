# Goal
SparseData Cluster is a tool for clustering and related analyses on any dataset

# Application
The specific application that sparked this application was analyzing gene expression data from RNA-Seq experiments but the same types of analysis can be applied in numerous areas. The items you want to cluster and rank are referred to as *observations* while the measurements made on the observations are referred to as *features*.

# Example
Don't have your own data handy?  Download [mtcars](https://internal.shinyapps.io/gallery/066-upload-file/_w_ea0a7d8b/mtcars.csv) and then upload it in the **Upload** tab.

# Documentation
For more information, see the source code and README on the [Github page](https://github.com/sparsedata/cluster-analysis). **NOTE**: Currently the documentation is sparse but we are working on updating this.
